      | Hi! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in 
      a(href="//cs.washington.edu") Computer Science &amp; Engineering 
      |  at the University of Washington. I'm coadvised by 
      a(href="//homes.cs.washington.edu/~jfogarty/index.html") James Fogarty
      |  and 
      a(href="//www.smunson.com/") Sean Munson

      | I study how and why people use 
      a(href="//www.personalinformatics.org/") tracking
      |  technology today, create models and frameworks generalizing those findings, and implement and evaluate novel systems which resolve needs surfaced by the models and frameworks. I envision a world where a novice can be their own expert by identifying what they need to track to answer a question they have about their habit or their body, finding a tool that supports collecting data that can help answer that question, drawing accurate conclusions from the data collected, and receiving encouragement and advice from others along the way.
