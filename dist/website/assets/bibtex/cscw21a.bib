abstract = {Contact tracing apps have been suggested as a promising approach towards containing
viral spread during pandemics, yet their actual use in the COVID-19 pandemic has been
low. While researchers have examined reasons for or against installing contact tracing
apps, we have less understanding of their ongoing use and how they interact with everyday
pressures related to work, communities, and mental well-being. Through a survey of
153 working people in Japan and 15 follow-up interviews, we investigated attitudes
toward installing and using Japan's national contact tracing app, COCOA, and how these
related to respondents' daily lives, work structures, and general attitudes about
the pandemic. We found that motivations about installing the app differed from those
related to ongoing usage. Specifically, we identified ways that people navigate uncertain
norms of behaviour during the pandemic, and how people consider individual risks such
as COVID-related stigmas, anxiety, and financial precarity when deciding if and how
to use COCOA. In light of these, we discuss the tension between COCOA's design and
desires to protect oneself by selective controlling disclosures. We note that perceived
risks are closely tied to respondents' local contexts, and based on our analysis,
we identify ways to address these challenges and tensions through design interventions
at multiple scales.},
