abstract = {Child-owned activity trackers are not only devices for self-tracking, but they are also co-used by children and parents for family-centered health and wellbeing. This presents a challenge for the design of this technology as children's and parents’ wants and needs from this technology are not always aligned. To further understand children's and parents’ ideas and expectations, we conducted a qualitative study utilizing co-design sessions and semantic differential scales. Data from five families show four trends: 1) representation of parental worries and values as tracking metrics, 2) wish to access the unknown, 3) the significance of smartphones and touchscreen imagery on children's visual language, and 4) concerns around child's privacy and autonomy. These trends can be interpreted as a potential for activity trackers to mediate family interaction and to structure family conversations around worries, values, and privacy during co-use.},
