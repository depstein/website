		<p>I am an Assistant Professor in <a href="//informatics.uci.edu/">Informatics</a> at the University of California, Irvine.</p>
		<p>I study how personal <a href="//www.personalinformatics.org/">tracking</a> technology can acknowledge and account for the realities of everyday life. More people are tracking today than ever before, and as a result they bring more varied expertise and goals than many apps and devices are designed to accommodate. I examine how the design of tracking technology can be improved, often prototyping and evaluating new design ideas.</p>
		<p>My research is generously supported by the National Science Foundation and internal UCI programs.</p>
		<p>I completed my Ph.D. in <a href="//cs.washington.edu">Computer Science &amp; Engineering</a> from the University of Washington, where I was coadvised by <a href="//homes.cs.washington.edu/~jfogarty/">James Fogarty</a> and <a href="//smunson.com">Sean Munson</a>. I received my B.S. in <a href="//cs.virginia.edu/">Computer Science</a> from the University of Virginia.</p>
		<p>When I'm not working, I try to spend time outside by hiking or running. I also collect turtle figurines, plushies, and pictures.</p>
