  abstract = {We study the inclusion of a social awareness stream (SAS) in the peer-to-peer payment
  app Venmo. While SASs are prominent in many social network sites, such as Facebook
  and Twitter, Venmo's use offers an illustrative example of how SASs can be used in
  task-oriented apps, particularly in a domain, finance, which people often view as
  sensitive. Through interviews with 14 Venmo users and surveys of 164 peer-to-peer
  payment app users and 80 Venmo users, we find uses consistent with other SASs and
  uncover novel uses that reflect the unusual inclusion of an SAS within a utilitarian
  app for personal finance. For many users, the SAS is a flexible feature that creates
  an experience that blends their task-driven use with social benefits. People write
  purely functional transaction descriptions with strangers, while in transactions with
  friends, they sometimes craft playful descriptions that enhance their experience or
  perform their social relationships. The SAS provides opportunities for learning about
  how to use the application and for keeping up with friends. The results of this study
  extend the CSCW community's knowledge of SASs and offer guidance to designers considering
  use of SAS in a variety of applications.},
