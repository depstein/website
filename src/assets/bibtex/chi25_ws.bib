abstract = {This workshop will gather the health and well-being (henceforth “Health”) research community to prepare and kickstart an independent conference. While there is substantial research at the intersection of HCI and Health, there is not yet a SIGCHI-sponsored conference dedicated to the HCI and Health community. The workshop will bring together the broad community of academic and industry researchers across Human–Computer Interaction, medical informatics, health informatics, and digital health. This widespread Health community also brings diverse approaches to epistemology and research, requiring that we work towards defining the scope, audience, and methods that will establish a shared language while welcoming areas of growth. This workshop will be an opportunity for the fledgling community to start important discussions around what constitutes a contribution for the Health community.},
