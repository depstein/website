abstract = {Pregnancy is a significant but stressful life transition, requiring effort from multiple stakeholders including expectant parents, family members, and friends to navigate. Existing work has primarily focused on understanding and supporting the technology use of pregnant people, neglecting other stakeholders' needs and participation. We therefore consider how pregnancy tracking apps both improve and interfere with the reconfiguration of social relationships caused by pregnancy, drawing on insights from family sociology to examine how these relationships evolve over pregnancy and the transition to parenthood. We reviewed the features of 20 pregnancy tracking apps, and analyzed 4,709 public reviews of them, finding that stakeholders used apps to bond with one another around the excitement of pregnancy, build a prenatal relationship with the fetus, and co-manage pregnancy-related logistical tasks. We find that not accounting for fetal demographics and users' identities, along with socio-cultural norms around gender and parenting roles, often inhibit these collaborative practices. We therefore suggest designing collaborative pregnancy tracking technology that considers both inclusiveness and specificity regarding stakeholders' different roles and relationships to pregnancy.},
