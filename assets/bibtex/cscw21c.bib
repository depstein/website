abstract = {Studies of personal informatics systems primarily examine people's use or non-use,
but people often leverage other technology towards their long-term behavior change
processes such as social platforms. We explore how tracking technologies and social
platforms together help people build healthy eating behaviors by interviewing 18 people
who use Chinese food journaling apps. We contribute a Model of Socially Sustained
Self-Tracking in personal informatics, building on the past model of Personal Informatics
and the learning components of Social Cognitive Theory. The model illustrates how
people get advice from social platforms on when and how to track, transfer data to
and apply knowledge from social platforms, evolve to use social platforms after tracking,
and occasionally resume using tracking tools. Observational learning and enactive
learning are central to these processes, with social technologies helping people to
gain deeper and more reliable domain knowledge. We discuss how lapsing and abandoning
of tracking can be viewed as evolving to social platforms, offering recommendations
for how technology can better facilitate this evolution.},
