abstract = {The Workgroup on Interactive Systems in Healthcare (WISH) connects academic and industry researchers across human-computer interaction, medical informatics, health informatics, digital health, and beyond to foster a community around innovations in consumer and medical health and wellbeing. The WISH Symposium at CHI 2023 will regather the HCI health and wellbeing research community for the first in-person community meeting in four years, allowing us to discuss and disseminate findings, methods, and approaches towards understanding and creating interactive health and wellbeing systems. We will continue the tradition of providing mentoring opportunities for early- and mid-career researchers, ranging from undergraduates to post-PhD, to establish future generations of scholars in the area. This will be the tenth WISH meeting, following a successful tradition of workshops at relevant venues including CHI over the past decade.},
