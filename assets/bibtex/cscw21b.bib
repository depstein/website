abstract = {People often turn to online health communities (OHCs) for peer support on their specific
medical conditions and health-related concerns. Over time, core members in OHCs build
a shared understanding of the medical conditions they support. Although prior work
has studied how individuals function differently in active sensemaking mode compared
to habitual mode, little is known about how OHCs disseminate their advice once their
core members operate primarily in habitual mode. We qualitatively observe one such
OHC, 'Surviving Antidepressants', to understand how collectively-built protocols are
disseminated in the important domain of discontinuing psychiatric drugs. Psychiatric
drugs are widely prescribed to treat mental health diagnoses, but, in certain cases,
discontinuation might be clinically advisable. Unfortunately, some people experience
severe withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation, even when following medical advice,
and thus turn to OHCs for support. We find that collectively-built protocols resemble
medical advice and are delivered in a top-down fashion, with staff members being the
primary source of informational support. In contrast, all members provide emotional
support and exchange advice on navigating the medical system, while many express their
distrust of the medical community and pharmaceutical companies. We also discuss the
implications of OHCs offering advice outside of the medical system and offer suggestions
for how OHCs can collaborate with healthcare providers to advance scientific knowledge
and better support people living with medical conditions.},
