abstract = { Online health communities (OHCs) are spaces where people gather for informational
and emotional support around specific medical conditions and concerns. Although OHCs
are an active and exciting research area that continuously attracts a wide range of
approaches and methodologies, the focus has been mostly on a limited selection of
OHCs or medical conditions. At the same time, there are novel challenges that OHCs
face, including changes to the medical system resulting from the COVID-19 crisis,
increased medical misinformation propagating online, and additional focus on personalized
medical advice that is less attainable in traditional medical systems. This workshop
will bring together researchers to discuss and produce generalizable lessons about
membership, structure, and support in OHCs in the context of these novel changes,
generating research agendas for future exploration and design of OHCs.},
