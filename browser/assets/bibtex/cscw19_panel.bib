abstract = {Research in the fields of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer
Interaction (HCI) is increasingly examining topics surrounding women's health. Many
of these works convey that women's health cannot be isolated from various social and
affective aspects of health, strongly suggesting a more holistic engagement with women's
wellbeing instead. Extending beyond wellbeing, we find that much prior work is committed
to promoting women's empowerment along various dimensions, such as being more in control
of their bodies, having the freedom to express themselves online, being able to secure
access to computing education, among other goals. In this panel, we bring together
the voices of members of the CSCW community who actively care about women's health,
wellbeing, and empowerment in the worlds of research, design, and practice.},
